#toString

The console display of the User objects, which appear as some sort of memory address. We can fix this my introducing a 'toString' method into the User class:

~~~java
  public String toString()
  {
    return firstName + ' ' + lastName +' ' +  email +' ' +  password; 
  }
~~~

Run the app again, and verify that you can see the actual user details.

~~~
[Bart Simpson bart@simpson.com secret, Homer Simpson bart@simpson.com secret, Lisa Simpson bart@simpson.com secret]
~~~

The Guava libraries we imported:

- <https://github.com/google/guava>

contains some useful utilities for building toString. Introduce the following import into the top of the User class:

~~~
import static com.google.common.base.MoreObjects.toStringHelper;
~~~

and rewrite toString as follows:

~~~java
  public String toString()
  {
    return toStringHelper(this).addValue(firstName)
                               .addValue(lastName)
                               .addValue(password)
                               .addValue(email)                               
                               .toString();
  }
~~~

The above fragment will require this import:

~~~
import static com.google.common.base.MoreObjects.toStringHelper;
~~~

Run the app again, and note the slightly changed representation of the Users.

~~~
[User{Bart, Simpson, secret, bart@simpson.com}, User{Homer, Simpson, secret, bart@simpson.com}, User{Lisa, Simpson, secret, bart@simpson.com}]
~~~
