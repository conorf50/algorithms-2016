6. Variables
As before, run the program in debug mode and use Step Over to bring execution to the innerloop(...) method call.
Move the mouse pointer over one of the variables. It’s current value will be shown in a pop-up window(see next slide)

6. Variables
Also, current variable values are shown in the variables window in the top right of the Debug perspective
Step into the innerloop() method and monitor the changes to i and j as you step through the code 

7. Debug a program
Finally, get the java class from here and include it in Lab2. The program takes a string as input and reverses it (i.e. “banana” should return “ananab”). However it does not work. Confirm this by running it in Eclipse. Then use the debugger to find the problem and fix it.

The solution will be released next week...

8. The End
Congrats. You now know how to:
Use the debugger perspective in Eclipse
Step through code in a java program.
Monitor variable values in a java program.
Set breakpoints in a java program.
