#Stepping through code

You may want more control over the execution of a program to really understand what’s going on in the code.

Terminate your program if it is still running

Re-activate the breakpoint in the innerloop() method and run the program in Debug mode again. 
When the program suspends at the first break point, find the following buttons:

Find the Step Over button (using tool tip text) and click it to step though the code on line at a time.

- try this out by stepping over the innerloop() method call.

Find the Step Into button and use it to step through code. Step into will also go “into” any method calls.

- try this out by stepping into the innerloop() method call.

Finally, the Step Return allows you to return from a method call and suspends where the method returns.

- try this out by returning from the innerloop() method
