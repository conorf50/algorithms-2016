#Break Points

You can use break points to suspend execution at a particular line in your code. Set a break point by double clicking in the grey bar beside the first call to System.out.println as shown below.

Run the program in Debug as before. Execution will automatically suspend just before the breakpoint you have set.

## More Break Points
Put another break point somewhere in the innerloop(...) method and click on the Resume button.

You will notice execution now stops at every iteration in the innerloop(...) method. You should also notice the Variables and Break window in the top right corner of the Debug Perspective:

##Break Points Window

Use the breakpoint window to disable the second break point in innerloop(..) by unchecking the option.

Now resume the program again. You should now notice this checkpoint is ignored.
