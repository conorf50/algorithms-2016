#Debug Practice

Include this class here into your project:

~~~
package algorithms;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class BuggyStringReverse {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);

    String s;

    System.out.println("\n Please enter a String to reverse: ");
    s = stdin.next();

    stdin.close();
    System.out.println("The reverse of \"" + s + "\" is " + reverseString(s));

  }

  public static String reverseString(String s) {

    // initiate vars
    String rev = "";

    int counter = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      rev += s.charAt(s.length() - counter);
      counter++;
    }
    return rev;
  }
}

The program takes a string as input and reverses it (i.e. “banana” should return “ananab”). 

However it does not work. Confirm this by running it in Eclipse. Then use the debugger to find the problem and fix it.
