#Problem Specification

Develop a java program that reads in strings from the following URL and stores them in a sorted list.

- <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18678304/2011/BSc2/words.txt>

The user should then be able to enter a sub-string and the program should return a list of matching strings that contain the substring. All matching strings should be displayed, sorted and the search should be case insensitive.
                                                                                        
##Implementation Steps

- Create a class called WordList. An instance of the  WordList class should have a list of all the words from the URL above(hint: use composition). The WordList class should implement this interface.  

~~~
package algorithms;

import java.util.List;

public interface StringSearchInterface {

  public abstract List<String> getSubstringList(String subString);

  public abstract void addString(String s);

}
~~~

As you have not covered networking or exceptions in Java I’ve included a link to an example constructor for WordList(NOTE: it’s not complete!). However you should try to to figure out how to read from a URL yourself using the web (Try googling “read from url java”). Example constructor excerpt here:

~~~
  public WordList(String urlString) throws IOException {

    BufferedReader in = null;
    try {
      wordList = new ArrayList<String>();
      in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new URL(urlString).openStream()));
      String inputLine;
      while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null)
        wordList.add(inputLine);
    }
    finally {
      if (in != null)
        in.close();
    }
  }
