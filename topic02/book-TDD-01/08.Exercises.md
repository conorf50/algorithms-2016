###Data Structures

Step 6 used the ArrayList data structure. For an elegant introduction to this, and the collections framework as a whole, take a look at this trial here:

- <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html>

In particular, the ArrayList is discussed here:

- <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/list.html>

See if you can modify the code to use LinkedList instead of ArrayList. What would be the benefits?

###JSON

For many uses, XML has largely been replaced with JSON:

- <http://www.json.org/>

Which offers some considerable benefits as a simple representation of data structures. The XML library you used in Step 7 also supports JSON.

- <http://x-stream.github.io/json-tutorial.html>

There are only two small changes required to output JSON - which are contained in the first code fragment. The existing xstream jar file will not be sufficient for it to run (although it will compile successful). Following the instructions for incorporating a jar file in step 7, see if you can import these two libraries here:

- [jettison](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.jettison/jettison/1.3.7)
- [stax](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/stax/stax/1.2.0)

If these are part of the build path, then the xstream component should be able to generate json versions of the data structure.
