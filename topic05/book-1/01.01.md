#Eclipse: Data Generation

Create a new project in Eclipse called Lab6Sorting1. 

###Data Generation
- Create an implementation of the simplified Date class as shown in lecture slides. In addition:
	- add getters for all fields in the class.
	- Add a suitable toString() method.
- Create implementations of both the **Selection** sort and **Insertion** sort algorithms as described in the lecture slides. Remember that the *less()* and *exch()* methods in both Insertion and Selection are exactly the same, only the sort() method changes.
- Create a utility class called DateArrayGenerator that contains a method:
~~~
public static Date [] randomDateArray(int n)
~~~
that returns an array of n random dates over the last 100 years(1915-2015). Use the Date class from step 1. You can ignore accounting for leap years if you wish. Test it by including a main method in the class that outputs the following when run:
