#Recursive Exercises

Create a new project in Eclipse called Lab7Recursion.


- **Binary Number**. Write a recursive algorithm for finding the binary representation of a decimal number. (hint: repeatedly divide 2 into the decimal number and read the remainders backwards) .Provide a Java implementation, BinaryNumbers.java, and ascertain the growth order.

- **Reversing a String**. Write two methods, one non-recursive and one recursive, that returns a String that is the reverse of the input String.e.g. System.out.println(reverseString(“Darragh and Ronan”)); would print: “nanoR dna hgarraD”.

- **A Tree**. Create and run the following fractal program that draws a tree. You will need to put [stdlib_package.jar](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/stdlib-package.jar) on your build path. Modify the program such that it includes a four branches(e.g. include a forth recursive call).

```java
import edu.princeton.cs.introcs.StdDraw;

public class TreeFractal{
public static void tree(int n, double x, double y, double a, double branchRadius) {
    double bendAngle   = Math.toRadians(15);
    double branchAngle = Math.toRadians(37);
    double branchRatio = 0.65;

    double cx = x + Math.cos(a) * branchRadius;
    double cy = y + Math.sin(a) * branchRadius;
    StdDraw.setPenRadius(0.001 * Math.pow(n, 1.2));
    StdDraw.line(x, y, cx, cy);
    if (n == 0) return;

    tree(n-1, cx, cy, a + bendAngle - branchAngle, branchRadius * branchRatio);
    tree(n-1, cx, cy, a + bendAngle + branchAngle, branchRadius * branchRatio);
    tree(n-1, cx, cy, a + bendAngle,               branchRadius * (1 - branchRatio));
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    StdDraw.enableDoubleBuffering();
    tree(n, 0.5, 0, Math.PI/2, 0.3);
    StdDraw.show();
}
}
```

- **Cubes:** Consider the following recursive algorithm for computing the sum of the first n cubes: S(n) = 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + ... + n
<sup>3</sup>
```
Algorithm S(n)
//Input: A positive integer n
//Output: The sum of the first n cubes
if n = 1 return 1
else return S(n − 1) + n ∗ n ∗ n
```
Implement this is Java.
How does this algorithm compare with the straightforward non-recursive algorithm for computing this function?


- Design a recursive algorithm for computing 2<sup>n</sup> for any non-negative integer n that is based on the formula: 2n = 2<sup>(n−1)</sup> + 2<sup>(n−1)</sup>.
Set up a recurrence relation for the number of additions made by the algorithm and solve it.
Is it a good algorithm for solving this problem?


- Consider the following recursive algorithm.
```
Algorithm Min1 (A[0..n − 1])
//Input: An array A[0..n − 1] of real numbers
if n = 1 return A[0]
else temp ← Min1 (A[0..n − 2])
if temp ≤ A[n − 1] return temp
else return A[n − 1]
```
What does this algorithm compute?
Set up a recurrence relation for the algorithm’s basic operation count and solve it.
